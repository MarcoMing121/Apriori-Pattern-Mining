This is a sample code about the Apriori Pattern  Mining Algorithm with the sampling accelerating function

1. The first three variables are the parameters that can be tuned in for the sampling method (acceleration)

Sigma: the probability of error happening 
tolr: the tolerable difference if the itemsets are infrequent
sample_mode: decide to use the sampling method or not

Running TIme(not sampling): 84.354sec

Running Time(sigma = 0.01 , tolr = 0.01): 37.678sec
